## Overview
Web scraping project with Python and Selenium to retrive mobile app reviews from WEB. The ultimate goal is to use this data to analyse the Robinhood mobile app reviews to access the impact of the recent user complains about the company blocking user from buying some stocks, such as GME.

## The Challenge
Data is very important nowadays to understand some social phenomenas and their impact in businesses. As there was no dataset available with the Robinhood mobile app reviews, the challenge here is to get the necessary data to further analyse the public perception from the controversial business decision. To do that, this project aims to web scrape the mobile apps reviews, generate a dataset and save it.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.
